                <h1><a id="Programming">Why pair programming is important?</a></h1>
                <p>Pair Programming is a development technique where two programmers work together on a workstation. Compared to the traidional solo programming approach, pair programming has many advantages.
                </p>
                <p>It is believed that this produces the same amount of work as two separate programmers but with a higher quality. Further more, skills can also transferred between the two programmers, where the two have different experience and specialities. Ad-hoc training also occurs as one person shows the other some tricks, workarounds, etc.</p>
                <p>Other benefits of pair programming include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collective code ownership</strong> - everbody gains a working knowledge of the entire codebase</li>
                    <li><strong>Mentoring</strong> - Knowledge is transferred between the junior programmers or new team members when paired with a more experienced person on the team</li>
                    <li><strong>Team cohesion</strong> - People get to know each other more quckly and learn how to work with each other</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved morale</strong> - When done well, pair programming is mroe more enjoyable than programming alone</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.</p>

                <p><strong>Peter</strong> - So far I've enjoyed all my pairing sessions. The one that I enjoy the most is being able to bounce ideas with my pair, as well as learn from them. There isn't one session where I didn't learn anything new, and considering that I'm still a baby in my programming career, it is crucial that I'm always learning. Furthermore, it is also very enjoyable, especially when we are able to troubleshoot and resolve a bug. However, to have an effective pair programming, you really to communicate well with your partner. Both of you have to be on the same page and clearly communicate what it is you are working - communication is key here.</p>
